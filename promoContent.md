# What is the problem with social media and the news?
With the widespread adoption of social media in the last decade, people have increasingly gone online to share their opinions and discover others. This is especially prevalent in the realm of political discussion. The topic of politics is infamous for creating divisive arguments that cause rifts amongst family and friends. Therefore, people often avoid raising politics around people who may not share their ideological viewpoint with the goal of maintaining peace and a stable relationship. Furthermore, it is common for people to retreat into safe ideological spaces, full of similarly minded people who share their political persuasion. We call these spaces "echo-chambers". 
Research has found that these echo-chambers are self-perpetuating. Users submit politically biased or one-sided content to a group of equally biased or on-sided people who then share it to other groups of the same kind. Becoming known as a haven for people of a certain political perspective, the group attracts more and more like-minded members, continuously perpetuating the cycle, while never having a natural mechanism for including dissident opinions.

# How will sidechat change this?
Sidechat aims to end the echo chamber by allowing users to point out bias in news as part of a dynamic online social environment. Sidechat has jettisoned the traditional upvote/downvote system in favour of a political left/right rating system. If a news article posted to sidechat has been found to be biased in a particular direction, it will be given a rating to reflect this. Users can see if the articles they would most likely read are mostly skewed in one direction or if they are consuming a healthy balance of news. Users can also comment on sidechat's news articles and these comments are voted as either left or right by other users.

Over time, sidechat develops a profile of each user which is based on their comment and voting activity. The profile is hidden to everyone except the user and exists only to let the user measure how their own political biases might be actualized in their online presence.
